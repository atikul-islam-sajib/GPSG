# Project Title: GAN with PyTorch

## Overview
Briefly describe your project here. Explain that it's a Generative Adversarial Network implemented using PyTorch, focusing on generating images with the MNIST dataset.

Example:
> This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using PyTorch to generate digit images similar to those in the MNIST dataset. It includes a Generator for creating images and a Discriminator for distinguishing between real and generated images.

## Installation

Instructions for setting up the project environment.

```markdown
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/atikul-islam-sajib/GPSG.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd GPSG
   ```
3. Install required dependencies (list any necessary libraries or frameworks):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
```

## Usage

Provide a quick-start guide or examples of how to use your project.

```markdown
To train the GAN model:

1. Run the main script:
   ```
   !python /content/GPSG/clf.py --batch_size 64 --lr 0.0002 --epochs 1 --latent_space 100 --download_mnist
   ```
2. Check the generated images in the specified output directory.

    ```
    !python /content/GPSG/clf.py --num_samplees 64 --generate
    ```
```
